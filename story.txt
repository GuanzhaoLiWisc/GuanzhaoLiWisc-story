On Tuesday me and my team mates walked in to the College Library.

We checked the main rooms in floors 2 and 3; however, all the tables were taken.
Fortunately, we found a booth in one of the side rooms where we could set up our computers and get to work on our x3 project.
Since all the members of X Team 82 are 1337 programmers, we were able to complete program x2 during our meeting.
